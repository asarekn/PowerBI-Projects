# Norwegian Olympics
Imagine walking into Olympiatoppen, the heart of Norwegian Olympic training, and being greeted by a data visualization dashboard that pulsates with the country's Olympic history. This dashboard, designed by me, isn't just about showcasing past glories. It's a battle cry, a data-driven roadmap to propel Norway to even greater Olympic heights. I dived deep into historical performances, comparing Norway to the world's best across sports, summer and winter. Not just about medals, but i unveil trends in athlete demographics and identify sports with explosive potential.
